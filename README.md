# Car_Price_Predictor
Second Task in Internpe Internship.
This is a machine learning project for building a linear regression model that is used to predict car prices.
# Aim
This project aims to predict the Price of a Car by taking it's name, Company name, Year of Purchase, no.of Kilometers it has driven and fuel type.
# Dataset
All the data was scraped from Quikr.com.
# Steps:
The data was cleaned and Exploratory data analysis was performed.
The data was splitted into training and testing dataset.
Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.84 R2_score.
Linear Regression model is used  to perform predictions.
